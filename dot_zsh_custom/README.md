# README.md

This directory contains custom configuration for my zsh environment:

- autoload: these files will be automatically sourced as long as they end in ".zsh"
- config_file/functions: contains autoloaded functions
- config_file: gets symlinked into the zi plugins directory as a local plugin
- config_file/completions (not currently used) directory for generated completions from RobSis/zsh-completion-generator
