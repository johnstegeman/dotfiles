## Installation

You can install chezmoi and apply this configuration in a single step:

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)" -- init --apply https://github.com/johnstegeman/dotfiles
```

If you have already installed chezmoi, you can clone this repository into the chezmoi source state directory - by default, in `~/.local/share/chezmoi` (if you already ran `chezmoi init` you might need to wipe out the source state directory first - I haven't tested this scenario).

Installation will:

- install chezmoi
- clone this repository to chezmoi's local state directory
- apply the chezmoi local state
- run scripts that:
   - Install homebrew (on MacOS)
   - Apply the homebrew bundle (in other words, install everything in the Brewfile)
   - Set up iTerm2 to read/store its preferences in the chezmoi local state directore - this so that the preferences will sync back to the repo
   - Install jbang (on Linux - jbang is installed via Homebrew on MacOS)
   - Install the Colemak DH keyboard layout (on MacOS)
   - Apply a prefered desktop background (on MacOS)
